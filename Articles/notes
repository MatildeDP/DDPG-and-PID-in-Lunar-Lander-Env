action space: continious and deterministic and we add noise via Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process

            # Action is two floats [main engine, left-right engines].
            # Main engine: -1..0 off, 0..+1 throttle from 50% to 100% power. Engine can't work with less than 50% power.
            # Left-right:  -1.0..-0.5 fire left engine, +0.5..+1.0 fire right engine, -0.5..0.5 off
